This sample is a simple application which shows depth stream from orbbec camera.
This is extracted from orbbec/OpenNI2.

To compile OpenNI2:
cd Packaging && python ReleaseVersion.py Android

The jni library (.so) will be built on Wrappers/java/libs/. Copy everything in there to the jniLibs directory.

The java wrapper is copy-paste from Wrappers/java/src/*

If OpenNI2 library modified, recompile it, and recopy the .so to the jniLibs directory. (Also the wrapper if it is needed)
